The topic of this work is collecting and storing data created by driver and passenger on a trip in real time using mobile application.
The goal of this paper is to help in research about driving preferences for different people and using collected data in order to
increase passanger satisfaction with the transport service. After first time accessing application, passanger and driver need to fill
a form about their driving preferences. Then, at the place of the complited ride, the passanger and the driver shall fill another
form about the experience of the trip itself. The main part of application is tracking passangerâ€™s comfort expirience. More
specifically, the passenger has the possibility to report predefined events (e.g. rapid braking, rapid acceleration, uncontrolled
steering) that he/she is experiencing during the ride. Reported incidents shall be logged in real time and stored in the database as
they would be available for further analysis.
